                <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Dan.</p>

<p>I work in IT and I&rsquo;m currently a Senior Solutions Engineer for BeyondTrust, a major player in the Privileged Access Management and Remote Access space. I&rsquo;m something of a jack of all trades - I know some stuff about on-prem and cloud infrastructure, scripting / development, operations, infrastructure management and deployment, and not least of all security. I should do at least - I&rsquo;ve been doing this for around 20 years.</p>

<p>My background is system administration for a global financial services company in Dublin, Ireland, where I worked for a large portion of my career. I got a lot of exposure to endpoint management, and used any opportunity I had to script and develop tools to automate things which would make my life easier. As well as the technical side of things, I got a lot of insight into being a customer - which has served me well when I got involved in the product sales cycle later on in my career. I also became intimately familiar with both the technical and the governance aspects of security. So much so that whoever put together ISO27001 would not want to run into me down a dark alley.</p>

<p>A few years ago I decided to upend my life and move to Toronto, Canada, and in the process, my career has become far more varied and interesting. I&rsquo;ve broadened my skills in security, co-founded a pretty damn cool open-source project that is in use on something ludicrous like 15 million endpoints (when we lost count, over 5 years ago!), learned a painful amount about cloud computing, DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code, become a pretty decent public speaker, did a stint as Integrations Product Manager at a very reputable endpoint security software company, and eventually managed to retool this website and write a few things about myself :)</p>
