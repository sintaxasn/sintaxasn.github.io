                <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Dan.</p>
<p>I work in IT and I&rsquo;m currently a Solutions Engineer for 1E, a major player in an emerging technology space - Realtime Endpoint Management. I&rsquo;ve been involved with Endpoint Management for over 20 years, with a large focus on OS and Application Deployment, Endpoint Security, Automation and and Privileged Access Management.</p>
<p>My background is system administration for a global financial services company in Dublin, Ireland, where I worked for a large portion of my career. I got a lot of exposure to endpoint management (SCCM / MEMCM, OS and Application Deployment, the McAfee ePO Suite etcc), and used any opportunity I had to script and develop tools to automate things which would make my life easier. As well as the technical side of things, I got a lot of insight into being a customer - which has served me well when I got involved in the product sales cycle later on in my career. I also became intimately familiar with both the technical and the governance aspects of security.</p>
<p>A few years ago I decided to upend my life and move to Toronto, Canada, and in the process, my career has become far more varied and interesting. I&rsquo;ve broadened my skills in security, co-founded a pretty damn cool open-source project that is in use on something ludicrous like 15 million endpoints (when we lost count, over 5 years ago!), learned a painful amount about cloud computing, DevOps and Infrastructure-as-Code, become a pretty decent presenter / public speaker, and was a Product Manager at a very reputable endpoint security software company.</p>
<p>Most recently though, I&rsquo;ve come full circle though and moved back to my old stomping ground, Endpoint Management. It&rsquo;s nice to be home and has an amazing community around it. And I&rsquo;ll say this&hellip; Covid sure has made this a very interesting space to work!</p>
